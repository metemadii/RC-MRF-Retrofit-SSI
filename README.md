# RC-MRF Retrofitting with Steel Bracing: Design Information and Modeling Data

This repository provides modeling data and design information for nine archetype intermediate reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames (MRFs) buildings with heights of 4, 8, and 12 stories, founded on three soil classes, and retrofitted with steel X-braces. 
The dataset includes structural design properties, geotechnical characteristics, foundation design details, retrofit configurations, and earthquake ground motion records.
